Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. 

If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is 5 feet or shorter?

If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is 6 feet or taller?

If we pick a female at random, what is the probability that she is between 61 and 67 inches?

Compute the probability that the height of a randomly chosen female is within 1 SD from the average height.
