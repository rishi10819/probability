-------------------------------
An American roulette wheel has 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green pockets. 
Each red and black pocket is associated with a number from 1 to 36. 
The two remaining green slots feature "0" and "00". 
Players place bets on which pocket they think a ball will land in after the wheel is spun. 
Players can bet on a specific number (0, 00, 1-36) or color (red, black, or green). 
What are the chances that the ball lands in a green pocket?
-------------------------------
In American roulette, the payout for winning on green is $17. 
This means that if you bet $1 and it lands on green, you get $17 as a prize.
Create a model to predict your winnings from betting on green one time.
-------------------------------
Using the chances of winning $17 (p_green) and the chances of losing $1 (p_not_green), 
calculate the expected outcome of a bet that the ball will land in a green pocket.
-------------------------------
Compute the standard error of random variable, which represents a single outcome after one spin of the roulette wheel.
-------------------------------
Now create a random variable S that sums your winnings after betting on green 1,000 times.

Specify the number of times you want to sample from the possible outcomes.
Be sure to assign a probability to each outcome and to indicate that you are sampling with replacement.
-------------------------------
Using the chances of winning $17 (p_green) and the chances of losing $1 (p_not_green), 
calculate the expected outcome of a bet that the ball will land in a green pocket over 1,000 bets.
-------------------------------
What is the standard error of expected value ?
