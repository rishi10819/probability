Two teams, A and B, are playing a seven series game series. 
Team A is better than team B and has a fixed "p <- 0.75" chance of winning each game.
Compute the probability for different series lengths. 
For example, wins in best of 1 game, 3 games, 5 games, and so on through a series that lasts 25 games.
Then plot the result plot(N, Pr).
