The Cavs and the Warriors - Monte Carlo

Simulation to estimate the probability of the Cavs winning the series after losing the first game.

Use B <- 10000 simulations.

Simulate a series of 6 games with random, independent outcomes of either a loss for the Cavs (0) or a win for the Cavs (1) in that order.
Determine whether a simulated series contained at least 4 wins for the Cavs.

Find the proportion of simulations in which the Cavs win at least 4 of the remaining games.
