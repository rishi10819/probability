Sampling with replacement.

You have a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls. 

Consider taking two draws. 
After taking the first draw and recording the color, return it back to the box and shake the box.
Then take the second draw.

What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?



Say you’ve drawn 5 balls from the a box, with replacement, and all have been yellow.
What is the probability that the next one is yellow?
