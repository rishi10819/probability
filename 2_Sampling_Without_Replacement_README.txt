Sampling without replacement.

You have a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls. 

Consider taking two draws. 
You take the second draw without returning the first draw to the box. 

What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?
