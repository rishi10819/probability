Create a Monte Carlo simulation by estimating how frequently the Celtics win at least 1 of 4 games. 
Use B <- 10000 simulations.

Within each simulation, simulate a four-game series.
Find the proportion of simulations that contain at least one win for the Celtics out of four games.

Calculate the frequency out of B iterations that the Celtics won at least one game.
