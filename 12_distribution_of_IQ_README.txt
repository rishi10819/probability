The distribution of IQ scores is approximately normally distributed. 
The expected value is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. 
Suppose you want to know the distribution of the person with the highest IQ in your school district, where 10,000 people are born each year.
Generate 10,000 IQ scores 1,000 times using a Monte Carlo simulation. 
Make a histogram of the highest IQ scores.
